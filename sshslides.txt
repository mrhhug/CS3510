	TITLE:
		SSH (Secure Shell aka Secure Socket Shell) - is a network protocol to establish a secure channel between two computers for data exchange
	TEXT:
		A sample terminal SSH logon - GUI clients also available.

SSHslide1:
	TITLE:
		SSH uses a client server model - client program is needed by accesor, daemon service is need by accessee
	TEXT:
		Client program can connect to one daemon at a time, daemon can serve many clients simultaneously
			BULLET: Mutlithreaded operating system could run multiple client programs simultaneously
		SSH daemon, by default, listens on the standard TCP port 22 - the port is often changed as a security measure
			BULLET: SSH daemon listens only on the configured ports 
				SUBBULLET: all other ports ignored
		establishing a SSH connections requires:
			BULLET: Host
			BULLET: Host port
			BULLET: Authentication

SSHslide2:
	TITLE:
		SSH can also be used for secure tunneling and file transfers
	TEXT:
		Tunneling
			BULLET: Encapsulation
				SUBBULLET: TCP port forwarding
				SUBULLET: X11 connections
					SUBSUBBULLET: Remote GUI sessions
{IMAGE image1.png (possibly insert image of remote GUI session - will be image1.png)}
		File Transfers
			BULLET: SCP (Secure copy)
SSHslide3
	TITLE:
		SSH is a replacement for telnet and rlogin - SSH's major advantage is that SSH does not authenticate in plaintext
	TEXT:
		The proliferation of public networks necessitated the evolution of SSH\n
		SSH security is implemented through ciphers\n
		SSH uses public key cryptography for authentication
		Authentication ciphers
			BULLET: DSA or RSA
		encryption ciphers
			BULLET:	3DES
			BULLET:	Blowfish
			BULLET:	Twofish	
			BULLET:	Arcfour
			BULLET:	Cast128

	TITLE:
		Authentication - public key authentication
	  SUBTITLE
	  		Typing passwords to establish every connection is optional with SSH
	TEXT:
		SSH can automatically generate a one time key pair or permanent key pairs can be used
		Public key authentication happens in two parts, a public key and a private key
			BULLET: automatically generated key pairs will be used once and require the user to enter a password
			BULLET: permanent keys are stored on the accesser and accessee's computers and do not require the user enter a password
				SUBBULLET: accesser stores private key
				SUBBULLET: accessee stores public key
		{redundant to really hit the point home} SSH always uses public key authentication, using a a permanent key pair will bypass passwords.
